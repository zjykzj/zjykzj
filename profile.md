## About ME

I am a computer vision development engineer. At present,  I focus on the development and optimization of object recognition algorithms, including object classification (coarse-grained and fine-grained), network pruning and knowledge transfer.

## Educations

* 2015 - 2019
  * Master Degree of Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University
* 2011 - 2015
  * Bachelor Degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University

## Experiences

* 2021 - Now
  * Computer Vision Development Engineer in YOYO;
  * Algorithm development, including the optimization of reasoning time and detection accuracy of fresh identification algorithm, and the development of SDK to adapt NPU development board.
* 2021 - 2021
  * Machine Vision Development Engineer in Webace-I3C;
  * Engineering development, involving the fields of object detection, video understanding and OCR.
