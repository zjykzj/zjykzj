# About ME

I am a computer vision development engineer. I am currently working with an AI startup company to develop recognition algorithms for fruits and vegetables.

At present,  I focus on the development and optimization of object recognition algorithms, including object classification (coarse-grained and fine-grained), network pruning and knowledge transfer.

## Learning

* master (2015-2019):  Computer science and technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, China
* bachelor (2011-2015): Electronic information science and technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, China

## Career

* Computer vision development engineer (yoyo, 2021 - now): Identify vegetables and fruits
* Machine vision development engineer (webace-i3c, 2020 - 2021): video understanding, object detection and OCR algorithm development
