# About ME

I am a computer vision development engineer. I am currently working with an AI startup company to develop recognition algorithms for fruits and vegetables.

At present,  I focus on the development and optimization of object recognition algorithms, including object classification (coarse-grained and fine-grained), network pruning (Channel pruning) and knowledge distillation
